A unit converter is a simple yet essential tool used to convert values from one measurement system to another. In everyday life, we frequently deal with quantities like length, weight, temperature, and time, which may appear in different units depending on the region or context. Converting these values manually can lead to errors and take unnecessary time.
This project aims to develop a Python-based Unit Converter that automates this process, ensuring accuracy, speed, and user convenience.

2. Objective

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a program that can efficiently convert values across multiple measurement categories such as length, temperature, weight, and time. The system should be user-friendly, accurate, and easy to extend for additional units.
